Welcome to the Spotify 2023 Top 10 Singers Analysis project!
In this project, I have performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the list of the top 1000 songs of 2023 on Spotify.
The main focus is on identifying the top 10 singers with the highest number of songs on the list.

   - An interactive Tableau dashboard is created to showcase key insights about the top 10 singers.
   - The dashboard includes visualizations for:
     - Number of songs for each singer.
     - Total streams for each singer.
     - Total playlists that the song is in for Spotify and Apple.
     - Average danceability percentage for each singer.
     - Average energy percentage for each singer.
